# Baseline Reproducer Skill

[中文](README.md) | English

An evidence-gated Agent Skill for auditing and reproducing published ML/AI baselines.

```text
artifact audit → checkpoint smoke → evaluator replay → checkpoint metric
→ training smoke → full training reproduction
```

It keeps deployment, inference, evaluator, checkpoint and training evidence separate, and treats a well-supported stop decision as a valid outcome.

## Core principles

- Prefer official code, released weights, and official evaluators over generating a new implementation from the paper.
- Split a paper into atomic claims and track evidence for each claim separately.
- Distinguish evaluator replay, released-checkpoint metric reproduction, and full training reproduction.
- Pin code revisions, artifact hashes, data splits, seeds, and evaluation protocols.
- Retain failed runs, compatibility changes, resource interference, and invalidated results.
- Stop explicitly when critical data, weights, or protocol details are missing; do not make an unlabelled substitution.
- Start expensive training only after checkpoint verification and the training gate are complete.

## Install

Copy or symlink `baseline-reproducer/` into the skill directory used by Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another Agent Skills-compatible client.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/baseline-reproducer" ~/.codex/skills/baseline-reproducer
```

Then ask: “Use `$baseline-reproducer` to audit this paper's official artifacts and reproduce the strongest claim the public release supports.”

## Helper

```bash
python baseline-reproducer/scripts/repro_case.py init work/my-paper \
  --paper-id my-paper --title "My Paper baseline reproduction"
python baseline-reproducer/scripts/repro_case.py validate work/my-paper
```

The helper validates evidence-package structure, not scientific truth.

## Origin

The workflow was distilled from a long-running reproduction effort across released video-generation checkpoints, evaluators, public datasets and multi-GPU paths. It generalizes identity freezing, protocol lanes, output-integrity audits, evaluator replay, non-overwriting evidence, explicit invalidation, and refusal of scientifically material substitutions.

No private artifacts, credentials, machine paths, or experiment data are included.
